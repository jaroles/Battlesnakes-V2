BattleSnakes V2 (V 0.5)
Welcome to BattleSnakes, where the goal is to gather eggs and bring them back to your hatchery to spawn mini-snakes.
These magnificent little snakes attack your enemy's hatchery, so the more snakes, the more likely you are to win.
Watch out for enemy snakes while you gather eggs though! If they run into you, you'll lose your body, and the eggs that you have collected.
Make use of your boost function (Space Bar) and hiding in the bushes to get the advantage on your enemy!
